Multi dimensional scaling
==================

The following has various codes to test MultiDimensional Scaling (MDS)
for data of final 2 dimensional output

The following methods are implemented
 - Simulated annealing
   Various variations of simulated annealing are imlemented.
   The non-standard simulated annealing extension project of gsl
   is used.
    - Basic
    - Multibest
    - Manybest
    Each of the above in direct random point and through simplex
    is computed
